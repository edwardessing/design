Time, matter, space and light intermesh with the activities of a modern city forcing us to reconsider assumptions of urban planning. And in the middle zone between landscape and city, there is hope for a new synthesis of urban life and urban form.

        <p>
The experience of parallax - the arrangement of surfaces defining space due to the change in position of a viewer - is transformed when movement axes leave the horizontal dimension. Vertical or oblique directions of movement through urban space multiply its experience. Spatial definition is ordered by angles of perception. The edges, contours and surfaces of the structures that define urban spaces (redefined in parallax) must be considered in terms of the phenomenon of light. The movement of sunlight exerts relational forces on spatial definition that engage the body of a stationary building. Forces of sun, shadow and the reflectivity of materials interact.

        <p>
A place to simply stand and reflect can serve to characterise a much wider and deeper space. This built form does not represent one particular style of architecture, but through its symbolic associations, it belongs to a particular era and brings those philosophical associations to the mind of the viewer.

        <div class="note-text"><h2>Blue light</h2>
        <p>
The definition of city spaces at night depends on ellipses of projected light, glowing glass facades, and the transformations induced by mists and rain. A dense complex of blocks cut by a canyon street by day is redefined by night as shimmering prisms of light in a chiaroscuro of shadows. There are astonishing effects of vapours of fog at night when clouds of white light surround the tops of lighted towers, or golden gauzelike ribbons radiate into the night sky. Beyond drawing-board geometry, the actual spatial definitions of the city are interlocked in a web of relationships with movement, parallax and light.

        <p>
The problem of proposing urban space for a metropolitan sector whose program elements, architectural parts and social aspects are as yet unknown (and may always be in some state of flux) leads us to propose beginning from a perspectival experience of bounded space. Potential alignments, partial exposures, and occupation of suggestive elements are all implied in a perspective view. Here the appetite of the field of vision invites the perceiver to invent. The next perspective view is provoked by the preceding view; spatial perspective drawings are not so much pictorial as they are indicative of a route complete with parallax.

        <div class="note-text"><h2>Field plan</h2>
        <p>
Envisioning urban space in perspectival views assumes a perceiver inserted into a condition meant to suggest and involve the imagination in envisioning what lies beyond. The point of view of the perceiver in an open field is not fixed. The perceiver has the authority to re-enter, to isolate his own vision within the organisation panned and expected. Rather than the establishment of a single centre with a symmetrical hierarchy, or reconciliation to the lack of any focus in a chaos of ‘decentering’, a re-entering allows for projection from a centre in each individual. There are multiple centres and multiple viewpoints in the urban field. A city sector is not made for a mass of 10,000; it is made for 10,000 individual souls. Each has the capacity to manifest a spirit and in turn animate psychological field of urban space.
