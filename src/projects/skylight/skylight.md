Skylight is a powerful, lightweight and interactive web experiment. The site was built from scratch and without any frameworks. Users are literally immersed in a gorgeous, full-screen, looped animation. There are several interactive touch points - including the ability to reposition your field-of-view, toggle the stylised HUD and select from a range of different backdrops.
