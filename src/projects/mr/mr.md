Mariniere is a serif font that comes in three weights - normal, medium and bold. The font was inspired by Changyuan Hu’s thesis SYNTHESIS OF PARAMETRISABLE FONTS BY SHAPE COMPONENTS (1998, read here: http://lspwww.epfl.ch/publications/typography/sopfbsc.pdf). The thesis proposes a 'new highly flexible font description method, which explicitly describes characters as structure elements, i.e., assemblies of parametrisable shape components'. Hence my focus was to create a modular font that deconstructs and re-uses as many shapes and measurements as possible. For reference, I looked mostly at 19th to 20th century transitional and Egyptian fonts. These fonts were mostly discovered from obscure texts in the Library of Congress’ online resource. The example text comes from The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1834) by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
