Courtesy of the Artist (COTA) is a compendium of stories and visual insights which shine a light on creative individuals and their studio practice. With a focus on innovation, style and provenance, COTA reveals a glimpse into the creative lives of artists, designers and makers with a shared passion for the handmade. COTA is an independently curated Gallery, Store and Online Magazine that maintains a diverse and active forum in which to engage with contemporary art, design and lifestyle products.‚Äù I was hired for a 3-month design internship with COTA where I was responsible for the production of a variety of design collateral. I also found the opportunity to pursue some self-initiated experiments including an editorial collaboration (pictured).
