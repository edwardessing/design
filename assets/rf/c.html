The wordless silence of architectural and urban form has a philosophical equivalent in phenomenology. Resisting the language-based approach of the deconstructivists its focus is on the experiential. Perception and the senses are intertwined with the material, space and light of urban form.

Light forms the intangible threshold for the interaction between the inside and outside spaces. Through the medium of light, we are still able to relate to an outside environment, despite being inside a built space.

        <p>
The space of a single room, like the vast space of a city, is defined by juxtapositions of matter. The stuff of which something is made has emotive qualities. The transparency of a membrane, the chalky dullness of a wall, the glossy reflection of opaque glass and a beam of sunlight intermesh in reciprocal relationships, forming the particular phenomena of a place. Given an architectural idea, the relationships of construction materials impose a dimension that penetrates perception through matter to tactility.

Touch permits a person to become intimate with what one is experiencing or feeling, whether it is an environment, the surface of the element, or a component. Touch enhances visual experience.

Matter interlocking with the perceiver's senses provides the detail that moves us beyond acute sight to tactility. From linearity, concavity and transparency to hardness, elasticity and dampness, the haptic realm opens. But this is a time of simulacrum, in which most things exist in order to represent something else. Mind-numbing replicas proliferate. Profitable mis-direction of human creativity has turned what was mere replication into an internal transplantation of cultural dimensions.

        <p>
A sacred space is conversant with private emotions and meanings. When such spaces are occupied, there is a possibility of an emotionally binding relationship between person and space that is not measurable. A sacred space gets back to the roots of wonder, often before they have a formal understanding of religion or what is generally viewed as sacred.

        <p>
For the imagist, simulation is the aim. What can be done with painted cardboard or facsimile plastic is expedient to the desired view. Wide-angle distortion of a color-corrected photograph becomes the final synthesis of an architectural project. The material and tactile dimensions of architecture are erased by the color photograph. Spatial proportions distended by lenses are now planned with the lens as an end. Uncritical and ambitious, the imagist-architect has allowed architecture to become simulation, oblivious to sensory essence.

        <p>
"If you will observe your own self and the outer world, and what is taking place therein, you will find that you...are that external world. You are a little world formed out of the large one, and your external light is a chaos of the sun and the constellation of stars. If this were not so you would not be able to see by means of the light of the sun." - <i>Jakob BÃ¶hme</i>

        <div class="note-text"><h2>Concealing</h2>
        <p>
If the imagist practices an architecture of "concealment," resistance takes form in an architecture of "revealing." Architecture of matter and tactility aims for a "poetics of revealing" (Martin Heidegger). "Revealing"requires an inspiration of joinery. A sense of the relation of detail to mass establishes a surface intensity and delicacy from the micro to the macro scale. Parallel to the emotive aspect of poetry, the emotive side of human nature is aroused by proportions and the tactile dimension. Initial concept provides the intellectual dimension that is given emotive form in material and detail. This relationship in a work establishes an emotional tie, in a psychological sense, to the experience of architecture. In a cultural sense, a decisive affirmation, even at the smallest scale, can bear out an argument for architecture over mere building (although this work is marginal in today's society of simulation).
