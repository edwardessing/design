In order to experience the full potential of this site, please keep in mind the following:
                    <br>
                    <br>i. The site navigation is triggered by the yellow square toggle found in the top-left corner of the screen.
                    <br>
                    <br>ii. The first gray section of a page (such as the one you are currently reading) will contain multiple slides. The next/previous slide is triggered by either using the the yellow triangles found at the far left and right of the page, or the arrow-keys.

Reframe began as an experimental image-making process. In early March 2014 I was playing around with simple silhouettes and architectural shapes, based on photographs I had taken earlier in the year (although at the time I had no intention of working with the photos). In exploring the design possibilities of the images I created a streamlined, easily repeated process. First, I would select a photograph characterised by strong architectural form, which could be read in isolation (ranging from turrets to archways). I then extracted this element and reshaped it into something wholly unique. From the final product it was nearly impossible to determine the original function or appearance. Instead the viewer is presented with a free-form, digitised statue. These statues are unrestrained by limitations of landscape or weight, yet they convey a very real physical potential. The question rings from the forms: what prevents the creation of these objects? Modern understanding of physics answers with nearly limitless possibilities.

The image-making phase was just the beginning of Reframe’s non-linear development. With a more substantial and graphic presence, the images took on great meaning. Tied to the experiential nature of the images, I sought a text component to compliment, intellectualise and fully realise what I was making – which, at the time, I was still a little unsure of. To narrow the search I focused on two topics: architecture and philosophy. Architecture was an obvious choice. At this point I was questioning how exactly I had ended up with the images: what had driven me to create them? Self-awareness of my loose meditations brought me to philosophy. Through this process I was introduced to architecture inspired by phenomenology.

                <p>
The final key component of Reframe was the interactive, generative graphics. At the beginning of each section of Reframe, the viewer is confronted with a darting, interactive environment that overlaps the static images and creates a dynamic illusion of perspective. Moreover, the viewer can play with the environment - moving and shifting the white debris to give a simple three-dimensional impression.

Ultimately, Reframe was an opportunity for me to do what I enjoy. The final product of Reframe - the repackaging, layout design, interactivity, discourse - has brought together a variety of technologies and practices (some old, some new) into an innovative platform.

Beyond the physicality of architectural objects and practicalities of programmatic content, enmeshed experience is not merely a place of events, things and activities, but something more intangible, which emerges from the continuous unfolding of overlapping spaces, materials and details.
